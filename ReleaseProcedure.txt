	(do sudo ./cleanAll/sh if necessary first)

3. Check for correctness of main projects:
	3.1 Open native project at fcids/test/fips-pi/fips-pi.xcodeproj
		Clean build for simulator - confirm you can enter/exit fips mode without error
		Clean build for device - confirm you can enter/exit fips mode without error
	3.2 Open cordova project at fcids/test/testcordova/platforms/ios/testcordova.xcodeproj
		Clean build for simulator - confirm database access has no errors and FIPS Status = 1
		Clean build for device - onfirm database access has no errors  and FIPS Status = 1

4. Clear out existing installation files at
	/usr/local/ssl/Release-iphoneos

4. Perform release:
	./doRelease Vx.y.z_mm-dd-yy

5. Install release files:
	sudo ./installFipsRelease.txt

6. Check for correctness of main projects:
	6.1 Open native project at fcids/release/Vx.y.z_mm-dd-yy/test/fips-pi/fips-pi.xcodeproj
		Clean build for simulator - confirm you can enter/exit fips mode without error
		Clean build for device - confirm you can enter/exit fips mode without error
	6.2 Open cordova project at fcids/release/Vx.y.z_mm-dd-yy/ttest/testcordova/platforms/ios/testcordova.xcodeproj
		Clean build for simulator - confirm database access has no errors and FIPS Status = 1
		Clean build for device - onfirm database access has no errors  and FIPS Status = 1

7. Copy release files to shared drive:
	/Volumes/shares/Groups/Tech Team/Current Projects/FIPS/release/FCIDS
	Update /Users/scoleman/dev/IOSFipsBuilds/test1020/fcids/ReleaseProcedure.txt
